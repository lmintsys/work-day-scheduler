# work-day-scheduler

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a simple work day scheduler (9AM to 5PM) that will allow users to add and save events for each hour. In addition, the user can see whether each event already happened, in the process, or will happen in the future, based on the current time.
Working on this project, I gained further understanding of JQuery and its ability to dinamically update HTML and CSS codes. I also learned how to use the Day.js library to access date. Finally, this project provided me with additional practice on saving information into the local storage of a browser.

## Installation

n/a

## Usage

When the user opens the application, they will see today's date at the top of the page. The user then can add events for any of the work hours and save them. When the user refreshes the page, the event will stay saved in the initial time block. Based on the current hour, each time block will indicate whether it belongs to the past, present, or future through different background colours: grey, red, and green, respectively.
